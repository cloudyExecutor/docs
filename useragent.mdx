<Info>
  Whether you're using WPF or WinForms, this step will be different.
</Info>



## WinForms

In WinForms, you'll need to set the user agent definition in the `Form1_Load` event.

```csharp
public Form1()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    Api.UserAgent(string executorname, int version);
}
```

here is a sample usage:

```csharp
public Form1()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    Api.UserAgent("your-executor-name", 1);
}
```

Replace "your-executor-name" with the actual name of your executor. The "1" represents the version of your executor.



## WPF

<Warning>
  in WPF, it's a little bit different; it needs to be set to `YOURWINDOWNAME()`.
</Warning>

```csharp
public YOURWINDOWNAME()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    Api.UserAgent(string executorname, int version)
}
```

Here is a sample usage:

```csharp
public MainWindow()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    Api.UserAgent("your-executor-name", 1)
}

```

Replace "your-executor-name" with the actual name of your executor. The "1" represents the version of your executor.
